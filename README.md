## Migration Story
This site was originally built from scratch by Habiba Mohamed using vanilla TypeScript and LitElement. In 2025, the project was migrated to a modern React app in partnership with GitHub Copilot and a knowledge graph MCP server. Copilot provided code suggestions, refactoring guidance, and automated much of the migration process, while the MCP server helped organize and contextualize the codebase. This collaboration enabled a smooth transition to a scalable, maintainable, and feature-rich React application.

## Setup & Development

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run locally:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view in your browser.

## Deployment

  ```sh
  npm run deploy
  ```
- The custom domain is set via the `CNAME` file in `public/`.
